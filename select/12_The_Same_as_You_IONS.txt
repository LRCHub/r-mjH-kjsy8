Ascending, ascending from denials

The same as you
I think I finally found a way
To understand both sides
And stop all ongoing fights
Which were highly ineffective

The same as you
I let my higher expectations overcome my heart
And set the fire in my eyes
Which makes me see in the red spectrum

The same as you
I'm carrying residues from my ancestors
Who did not get a chance as we do
To choose and learn from our issues

The same as them
By slowly moving through this battlefield
We do what needs to be done
To reassemble our hopes
From the shattered pieces

But somehow we're always in denial
Drifting apart
Descending, descending in your eyes
Crawling deep under the bar
Descending, descending in my eyes
Crawling deep under the bar

We're starting to crumble
Slowly fading into fire
And walking on the pieces of broken glass
Pieces of broken glass
Sharp pieces, sharp pieces of broken glass

Ascending, ascending of denials
Descending, descending in your eyes
Reflecting, reflecting on who we are
Reassembling all that's left behind

Transcending, transcending all denials
Reassembling all the pieces of broken glass
Transcending, transcending all denials
