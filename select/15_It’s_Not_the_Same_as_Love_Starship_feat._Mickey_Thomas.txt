What will it take to forget about the bond we have to break
What can I do to forget about the love I have for you
Try all you want to hide it, to me it's so clear
We can't go on just living a lie

It's not the same as love, it's not the same as love
If you never want more
It's not the same as love, it's not the same as love
So what'd you give it up for?
It's not the same if you never want more
It's not the same as love
Noooooo!!!

Too many times I forget about the way you cross the line
How did it feel you wanted me to know our love wasn't real
Turning in circles as you're coming right back around
And I can't pretend to let it go by

It's not the same as love, it's not the same as love
If you never want more
It's not the same as love, it's not the same as love
So what'd you give it up for?
Love, love it's not the same as love
Noooooo!!!...Noooooo!!!...
Love, love it's not the same as love
So what'd you give it up for?
It's not the same if you never want more
It's not the same as love

YEEEEAAAAH!!!

It's not the same as love, it's not the same as love
If you never want more
It's not the same as love, it's not the same as love
What'd you give it up for?!
Love, love it's not the same as love
Noooooooo!!!
Love, love, it's not the same as love
If you never want more
It's not the same if you couldn't be sure
It's not the same as LOOOOOVEEE!!!
Not the same as love
LOOOOOVEEE!!!
